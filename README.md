With getting better with numbers came learning how to become more technical, and learn more about online skills to help me along the way. Here I am in TripleTen now taking my knowledge one step further to create a wonderful and life long career for myself. I was very unsure, and nervous from the beginning, considering I have no experience in the field, but I find great satisfaction in using my self to create new skills, and finding out my true potential. 

- After completing high school, I enrolled in college at the University of Cincinnati for a veterinary tech degree, after completing 1 year of academics I decided that wasn't the path for me.

- A few years later I decided I need to find a career to support myself. So I decided to take on being a truck driver. After completing truck driving school, I found a local position hauling groceries for a major grocery store. I knew that this career wasn't for me, but it was just temporary.

- My next career move I know was going to be more intellectual, and was going to need more mental stimulation to keep me occupied and to my personal taste, a work from home job, which lead me too data!

Feel free to connect with me through email at Braykylie18@gmail.com or LinkedIn if you know of any open job positions in the data analyst field that matter up to my interests and skills. Im very excited to take on a new career role and new passion!</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1seS6-JKHXuqnYvvpm52IBvBwZ4BmYDZxjRJpONRulLw/edit?usp=sharing ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
